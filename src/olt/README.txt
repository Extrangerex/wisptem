RAISEPON 2.0

Raisepon is Opensource php/mysql software written to manage Subscriber base on RAISECOM's GPON/GEPON OLTs ISCOM5508(B), ISCOM5508-GP, ISCOM6820-EP, ISCOM6820-GP, 
ISCOM6860, ISCOM6800. Supported are most of RAISECOM ONUs.

Web interface is implemented with Bootstrap(https://getbootstrap.com/) and jQuery(https://jquery.com/). API relies on PHP-JWT(https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt)

Installation:

I suggest using latest FreeBSD or Debian Stable Release.

You need:

Apache 2.4 or later
PHP 7.0 or later 
PHP 7.x Extensions + Mysql PDO
Mysql 5.6 or later 
net-snmp + php-snmp
rrdtool + pecl-rrd(php-rrd in Debian)

Copy the files to your web folder.
Create database "raisepon" and load in it the supplied raisepon.sql file. 
Grant permissions to user for databse "raisepon". Modify classes/db_connect_class.php and dbconnect.php to match the mysql user,pass.


Add the following to your crontab if you want to have graphs:

*/5 * * * *     www     /usr/local/bin/php -f /path/to/your/webcontent/update_rrd_data.php > /dev/null 2>&1
*/15 * * * *     www     /usr/local/bin/php -f /path/to/your/webcontent/update_rrd_power.php > /dev/null 2>&1


Add also this if you want to use AUTO ONU registering based on Illegal ONUs found in OLT devices:

* * * * *     www     /usr/local/bin/php -f /path/to/your/webcontent/update_auto.php > /dev/null 2>&1

Add this if you configure backup of the database and OLTs' startup-config via ftp:

0 2 * * *     www     /usr/local/bin/php -f /path/to/your/webcontent/update_backup.php > /dev/null 2>&1


Configure your OLTs to send logs to your syslogd server. 

Edit your sylogd.conf:

local7.*                                        /var/log/raisepon.log

Create rrd/ directory under the raisepon root tree.

Default username/password for web interface admin/admin123.

Usage:
1. You need to add at least One OLT and one pon port to be able to add customers.
2. You can create also line-profile, service-profile and match them to Services ID in the web-interface. You need to pre-create the same profiles with same ids on the OLTs you are going to provision.
3. Clicking on INFO in index.html when you load the customers on selected OLT and PON will give you more information.
4. If you use AUTO assign of ONUs on certain OLT/PON port you can find created ONUs in UNASSIGNED before being automaticaly assigned by update_auto.php - executed every 5 minutes via crontab.
5. If you want to have backup of the startup-config and raisepon database. Configure xPON->Backup. Add FTP details for upload of the startup-config files from the OLTs and email-address for raisepon's db backup.
